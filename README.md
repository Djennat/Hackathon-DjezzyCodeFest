## 🤔 About Project

Create a Transparent Charity Donation System using Smart Contracts.


## 🔗The Design of Charity System Based on Blockchain
The charity system mode proposed is shown in the Figure below. There are four roles: donors,
charity organizations and cooperative stores that will be added in the futur. The charity organizations 
create charity projects through the platform. Donors learn about charity projects on the platform, 
then donate to the charity organizations. The transactions occurred in the stores will be uploaded to the charity platform. 
The cooperative stores supply services or goods to charity organizations.The flow of funds has been fully recorded on 
the blockchain, which allows transactions to be tracked and funds prevented from being abused.

### Platform Usage Process
1. Donor
After successful login, the donor browses the charity projects and select one project to be donated.Then if he procced to fund projects that he is interested in.
2. Charity organization
The organization can get donation from the platform to help other people and apply money to the 
cooperative.
3. Cooperative shops
The shops provides the corresponding services or goods such as medicines or books to the charity organizations.


### Dapp Model
Following functions have been met:
1. Charity organization initiates a charity project in the DApp.
3. Donor donates to the charity projects which he chooses.
4. Donor is able to track his funding in the charity project already participated.
5. Charity organization uplodes updates concerning the the charity project.
6. Cooperative shops initiates services in the DApp.

## 📃 Description

* We have created a Solidity Smart Contract for this cause and we have used web3, ganache-cli, mocha, to test out our contract.

* In the contracts folder, you will find a final solidity contract and the individual modules inside contracts_classified directory.

* On the Frontend Part we have html,css,javascript and full UI of Genuine Charity App along with Admin Panel in the website folder.

* Included a test directory with a test file to test all the functions used in the contract by deploying it on ganache and using web3 to utilize the ABI.

* Included a sample React Template so that the frontend can be used to include the website along with the test code to make a production app.

* Included code to compile the contract and to deploy the contract on the Rinkeby Test Network using the Infuria node module.

* The website and the test modules are not yet connected and the code is placed in seperate folders.

## 📝Applications
> Many fake charity organizations pose as genuine and loot money from innocent people in the name of charity. Most people want to donate money to a good cause of charity, but they are unsure if the money is going to reach the right hands of the destitute.  The blockchain system can bring transparency to online charity trusts. Contributors can see the journey of the donation in realtime and confirm if it’s reaching the deserving hands or not.
